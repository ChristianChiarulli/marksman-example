# Communication and Socialization

Cats use a combination of vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions to communicate with humans and other cats. Common vocalizations include meowing, which can indicate various needs or desires; purring, often a sign of contentment; and hissing, a warning signal. 

## Body Language

Body language, such as tail position and ear movement, also plays a crucial role in cat communication. Although cats have a reputation for being independent, they are social animals that can form strong bonds with their human caregivers and other animals.
